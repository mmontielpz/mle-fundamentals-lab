# MLE Fundamentals Lab

A public, weekly-updated lab to practice and demonstrate Machine Learning Engineering fundamentals:
theory, coding, toy examples, real-world projects, system design, MLOps, and productized deliverables.

## Repository map
- `01_theory/` concise notes and references
- `02_coding_fundamentals/` Python + DS&A patterns relevant to ML interviews
- `03_toy_examples/` small experiments to validate concepts
- `04_real_world_projects/` end-to-end projects with design decisions
- `05_system_design/` ML system design notes and diagrams
- `06_mlops/` operational practices and patterns
- `07_products/` minimal product artifacts (APIs, batch pipelines)
- `08_interview_prep/` curated questions + answers + drills

## Weekly cadence
Each week:
1) Add one focused deliverable
2) Document trade-offs and learnings
3) Publish a short LinkedIn update pointing to the folder + README
