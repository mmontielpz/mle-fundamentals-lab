# MLE Fundamentals Lab

A public, module-based lab to practice and demonstrate Machine Learning Engineering fundamentals
through focused, self-contained weekly modules.

Each module explores a single concept from first principles, combining theory, implementation,
experiments, and system-level reasoning.

## Repository structure

```
modules/
week_01_linear_regression/
theory/        # Assumptions, derivations, and failure modes
src/           # Reference implementations
notebooks/     # Experiments and diagnostics
experiments/   # Verification and comparisons

```

Each module is designed to be:
- Conceptually scoped
- Independently runnable
- Incrementally extensible

The emphasis is on correctness, clarity, and diagnostics rather than performance or abstraction.

## Scope and philosophy

This repository prioritizes:
- Understanding over tooling
- Explicit implementations over black-box usage
- Diagnostic reasoning over benchmark chasing

Production concerns, optimizations, and advanced infrastructure
are introduced only when they become necessary.

## Cadence

Each module:
1) Focuses on one core concept
2) Documents assumptions and trade-offs
3) Includes reference code and experiments
4) Is accompanied by a technical write-up

Selected modules are summarized and shared externally
as part of a continuous learning and documentation process.
